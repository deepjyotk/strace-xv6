# XV6 Strace Implementation

This project extends the XV6 operating system by incorporating `strace`, a debugging utility that monitors and records the system calls made by a process. The implementation aims to enhance debugging capabilities, offering insights into how processes interact with the kernel.

## Features

- **Trace System Calls**: Enable or disable tracing on demand for individual processes.
- **Selective Tracing**: Use flags to focus on specific system calls or outcomes.
- **Child Process Tracing**: Trace system calls made by child processes.
- **Readable Output**: Enhanced output formatting for improved clarity.
- **Option Handling**: Multiple options to tailor the tracing output.
- **Output to File**: Redirect tracing output to a specified file.

## Implementation Details

We integrated `strace` within the XV6 kernel, leveraging the existing `syscall.c` structure. This involved creating user-level commands (`strace on`, `strace off`, etc.) and modifying kernel-level handling to implement filtering and output options effectively.

## Getting Started

### Building XV6 with Strace

1. Clone the XV6 repository: `git clone [repository-url] xv6`
2. Navigate to the XV6 directory: `cd xv6`
3. Build XV6 with strace support: `make`

### Using Strace

Activate strace for a process:

```bash
strace on
```

Deactivate strace:

```bash 
strace off
```

Run a command with strace enabled: 

```bash
strace run [command]
```

Dump the most recent system calls:

```bash
strace dump
```

For additional options, see the command-line help:

```bash
strace --help
```



## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before installing XV6, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Git**: For repository cloning.
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, a robust compiler for C and other languages.
- **Make**: A build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries.
- **QEMU**: An open-source machine emulator and virtualizer.

To install these prerequisites on Ubuntu, Debian, or related distributions:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential qemu
```

For Fedora, Red Hat, or related distributions:

```bash 
sudo dnf install git gcc make qemu-system
```

### Cloning the Repository

Begin by cloning the XV6 repository into your preferred directory:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/harshitrajpal/strace-xv6
cd xv6-strace
```

## Building XV6

To compile the source code and build the XV6 operating system, run the following command:

```bash
make
```
